# homebridge-esp8266leds
An homebridge plugin that create an HomeKit Lightbulb that will work together with https://github.com/rvt/esp8266leds

# why yet another esp8266 led controller
A lot of EPS8266 let example I found use on/or or use 256 level RGB model. I wanted something more accurate when it came to color reproduction and better control over dimming.
esp8266 leds uses floating point math (floating point math on esp8266 is extreemly fast), uses cie1931 curve for dimming and uses a RGB map for color reproduction so that yellows are more yellow, and oranges, look more natural.
Dimming can be done in 2047 level instead of 256 as much other libraries use.

So for example when implementing a wake up light we get very gradual light incresements from very orange to light yellows.
